### Background
<Details>
  You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Vulnerability Assessment Report
**July 24th, 2023**

### System Description
Server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux OS and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections. 

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2022 to August 2022. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the informaiton system. 

### Purpose
The database server has been identified as a key business component. This server is valuble because it stores a large amount of records for companies idenitifed as potential new business. The data on this server should be handled with a secure mindset because it is a vital resource to bringing in new business, if the database were to be lost or damaged it would impact company revenue as the business teams would have to re-develop leads and information on potential customers. 

## Risk Assessment
|  Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| Competitor | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Employee | Modify or delete critical information | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Hacker | Interception of SSL traffic | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| System administrator | Makes unauthorized change | 3 | 2 | 6 |


### Approach
Assessed the technical state of the database as well as the management of the system in order to measure the overall risk. The likihood of the threat occurance and the severity in which it would impose were calculated based upon the type of data stored within the database, the known open access to the database and the comparison to common best practices within the industry. 

### Remediation Strategy 
It is highly recommended to implement principles of least privilege and seperation of duty within the organiztion via RBAC and organizations approval processes, this would ensure only authorized users gain proper permisisons to the database as well as further approval for major modifications or access. Additionally, mechanisms such as auditing and authentication should be considered as well. This would include actions such as requiring strong passwords, introducing MFA, log collection and alerting. These actions would aid in protecting access to the database and provide information in case of a future security event. 

Technically, there should be steps taken towards disabling SSL in favor of TLS for data in transit as it is a more secure encrytion method.
